Java 8 Exercises
================

Created for the purpose of hands-on workshop.

Contains both theory - in Java classes so you can play with it - and exercises (with hints) to solve on your own.

Solutions are also included. It is recommended that you collapse all methods as soon as you open Solutions classes and then only expand the method that you want to see. In IntelliJ it can be done by hitting `CTRL + SHIFT + -`.
